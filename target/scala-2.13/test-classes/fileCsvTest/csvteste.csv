G., Hanberger, H.","The clinical and microbiological efficacy of temocillin versus cefotaxime in adults with febrile urinary tract infection, and its effects on the intestinal microbiota: a randomised multicentre clinical trial in Sweden","Background: Use of third-generation cephalosporins, such as cefotaxime, is associated with an increased risk of selection for antimicrobial resistance, so alternative antibiotics need to be considered. The aim of the present study was to evaluate intestinal colonisation with third-generation cephalosporin-resistant pathogens following use of temocillin-an alternative antibiotic to cefotaxime that is potentially less prone to disturbing the intestinal microbiota-in empirical treatment of febrile urinary tract infection (UTI).",20220195799

A.",Routine universal testing versus selective or incidental testing for oropharyngeal Chlamydia trachomatis in women in the Netherlands: a retrospective cohort study,"Background: Pharyngeal Chlamydia trachomatis in women might contribute to autoinoculation and transmission to sexual partners. Data for effectiveness of different testing practices for pharyngeal C trachomatis are scarce. We therefore aimed to assess the prevalence of pharyngeal C trachomatis, determinants, and effectiveness of different testing practices in women.",20220195830
